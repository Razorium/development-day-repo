# AI Itinerary Generator 🌍

An AI Itinerary Generator powered by Google Gemini, built with NextJS, TailwindCSS, Axios, Prisma ORM, and PostgreSQL database. This itinerary generator uses API keys to generate response from Google Gemini.
Therefore, there is no need to setup any backend services. To run, just need to run the frontend locally and make sure the PostgreSQL database is running.
